# 2. Use Ruby on Rails

Date: 2025-01-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Ruby on Rails is one of two supported development platforms. The portfolio has
standardised on .Net, but the other application in the Get Help Buying for
Schools area is already implemented in Rails, and we want to be able to share
developers and skills.

## Decision

We will use Ruby on Rails.

## Consequences

We will be able to share developers with the other Get Help Buying for Schools
applications. We will not be able to get help from developers from elsewhere in
the portfolio, but there are other Ruby on Rails projects elsewhere in
the department.
