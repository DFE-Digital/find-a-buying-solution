## Getting Started with Development

Read [Setting up a development environment](doc/developer-setup.md) to learn
how to configure your local environment and get access to required systems.

### Docker

We will use docker locally to run OpenSearch.

Install Docker: [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)

This Docker for Desktop Mac install will be the easiest way to run it and it comes with both `docker` and `docker compose` shell commands.

Then you need to run `docker compose up`

To use the local search index, set `OPENSEARCH_URL` to
`http://admin:PASSWORD@localhost:9200` where `PASSWORD` is as specified in the
compose file.

Contentful webhook in local development

To recvice  contentful webhook,  you need will need to install `ngrok` to expose your local rails server

```
brew install ngrok

create a free account on with ngrok https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
copy auth toke
ngrok config add-authtoken {token}

ngrok http http://localhost:3000
```

You should get a screen like this
```
ngrok                                                                            (Ctrl+C to quit)

Forwarding                    https://e1507fc863f0.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:3000

Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
